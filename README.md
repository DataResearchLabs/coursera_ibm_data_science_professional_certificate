Coursera IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project.

As part of the capstone project, one of the deliverables is to link each artificate to the submission from your own GitHub account.  This is a nice touch because it forced me to create my own personal GitHub account earlier than I otherwise would have (have been using at work for years...now I have my own in which to start posting portfolio artifacts--nice!).

There were 9 total classes in this certificate program, but I only included the final capstone project Python notebook, Research Papaer, and Presentation in here...none of the other classes' contents are present.

This certificate took me 106 hours across 17 days.  My Jupyter Notebook research is 37 pages, and my research paper was 15 pages.  

I purchased the Coursera 1 year / $399 deal and was assuming the IBM Certificate fee of $42 would be waived / part of the Coursera annual subscription.  It is not, that was a bad assumption on my part.  IBM needs their cut of the training program too, hence the $42 is billed separately (or you could skip Coursera fees altogether and just pay for the IBM training only at $42).

Overall, a great experience.  Am happy I took the time to do the course and further refine my data science skills.
