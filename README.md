# Opening New Poke Restaurant in the City of Seattle

## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project.
This repository is  part of the IBM/Coursera capstone project.  A requirement is to link each of the three deliverablse (Jupyter Notebook, Report, Presentation) to the submission from your own GitHub account. Students choose their own problem to solve and find their own source data and execute their own analysis.  I chose  to find the optimal locaiton for a Poke restaurant in Seattle (where I live and because one of my favorite lunches at work was the Poke shop across the street -- before the pandemic made us work from home).
